Instructions : 

Requires python 2.7

execution python <python file> < optdigits-orig.windep

Used the 80 % of data as testing and 20 % of data as training

The testing and training data files are included in the folder.


The output for 10,100,500 hidden layears screenshorts are included in this folder..

We can observe that as we increase the no. of hidden layes the accuracy inceases.


Using 1024 features for neural network is very cumbersome
To avoid this we can take the bits which only covers the number in square shape. and can consider as the features.
Through this we can reduce the no. of features and works effectively.
